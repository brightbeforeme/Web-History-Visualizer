CS 448B todo list
These are things I've identified that need to be done. I'll post what I'm working on and what my progress is. They are not in any particular priority queue or order. Feel free to move stuff around or add/remove.

Finish before poster day:
- a bit of CSS polish (not too much, but just for flair)
- Give an interface for domain comparison
	- Pings graph
	- Focus graph as stacked area
	- Maybe have both graphs update at once (i.e. you specify a list of domains, and then each graph reflects that? The timescales on both are different but they can have independent timescales)

Finish in general (by Friday, we can do as much of this as possible):
- Make the bars in the "Top domains" section clickable and lead to the domain focus page
- Replicate the old history functionality
	- Pagination, so you can look at old history easily
	- favicons near urls
	- Search, if we have time
- Add in some more history list convenience features
	- Jump to a date
	- filter by domain
- more of a css overhaul
- Allow for changing timescale on most visited website (i.e. what are the most visited websites this month?)

Important things todo:
- CSS stuff
- More granular time stuff (tenths of hours instead of just hours; use granularTimes option)
- Ravi: the related work section of the paper, also look over and add to rest of paper
- Pagination of history view/figure out if we can just display everything for a given domain (or is that too much?)
- Get time scales to line up on the overview page
- Add loading gif in corner or something while large views are loading (this doesn't quite work right for some reason)


Possible future features (not right now, but eventually)
- Focus/context graphs: http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/zoom.html
